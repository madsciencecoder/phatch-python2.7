There is no need to install this, once you have unpacked it, use the run.sh script.

It can be run from any location, you can use command line or just make it
executable and double click it (make sure it is not opened for edit, of course).

Please note you cannot move the run.sh separately it to another location, 
move entire content of archive or make a symlink to run.sh.

This is intended for linux, of course.

Also note that you still need to have all dependencies installed, starting with python2.7 of course.
